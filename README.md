# Customizable Load Balancer

## Overview

This project implements a customizable load balancer that routes requests from multiple clients to several server replicas, ensuring an even distribution of load. The load balancer employs consistent hashing to distribute client requests efficiently among server instances. The project is containerized using Docker and includes various endpoints to manage server replicas and monitor their status.

## System Architecture

The system consists of a load balancer and multiple server replicas, all running within a Docker network. The load balancer exposes endpoints to interact with the server replicas, handle client requests, and manage server failures.

## Endpoints

### Load Balancer Endpoints
-** Before adding any Server to the System
```json
Response:
{
        "N": 0,
        "replicas": []

            "N": 1 i.e, 3,
            "replicas": [ i.e. "Server 1", "Server 2", "Server 3"]
        },
        "status": "i.e. successful"
    }
    ```

- **`/add` (POST):** Adds new server instances.
    ```json
    Request:
    {
        "n": 4,
        "hostnames": ["S5", "S4", "S10", "S11"]
    }

    Response:
    {
        "message": {
            "N": 7,
            "replicas": ["Server 1", "Server 2", "Server 3", "S5", "S4", "S10", "S11"]
        },
        "status": "successful"
    }
    ```

- **`/rm` (DELETE):** Removes server instances.
    ```json
    Request:
    {
        "n": 2,
        "hostnames": ["S5", "S4"]
    }

    Response:
    {
        "message": {
            "N": 4,
            "replicas": ["Server 1", "Server 3", "S10", "S11"]
        },
        "status": "successful"
    }
    ```
-** Mapping
- **`/<path>` (GET):** Routes the request to a server replica. Example: `/home`
    ```json
    Response:
    {
        "message": "Hello from Server: 3",
        "status": "successful"
    }
    ```

## Consistent Hashing

The load balancer uses consistent hashing to evenly distribute client requests among server instances. The following parameters and hash functions are used:

- **Number of Server Containers (N):** 3
- **Total Number of Slots (#slots):** 512
- **Number of Virtual Servers per Server Container (K):** 9
- **Hash Function for Request Mapping (H(i)):** i + 2*i^2 + 17
- **Hash Function for Virtual Server Mapping (Î¦(i, j)):** i + j + 2*j^2 + 25

### Implementation Details

- **Consistent Hash Map:** Maps client requests to server instances in a circular data structure to avoid data shifts during server addition or removal.
- **Server Addition:** Adds a new server instance and redistributes requests.
- **Server Failure:** Detects server failure using the `/heartbeat` endpoint and redistributes requests to maintain balanced load.
- **Virtual Servers:** Uses multiple virtual replicas for each server instance to ensure even load distribution.

## Analysis

### Performance Experiments

- **Load Distribution:** Launch 10,000 async requests on 3 server containers and visualize the request count handled by each server in a bar chart.

- **Scalability:** Increment the number of server containers from 2 to 6 and launch 10,000 requests at each increment. Plot the average load in a line chart.

- **Failure Recovery:** Test all endpoints and demonstrate the load balancer's quick recovery from server failures.

- **Hash Function Modification:** Modify the hash functions and report observations on load distribution and scalability.
